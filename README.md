# Code Challenges
**The goal of this repository is to help facilitate learning from each other, and have fun while doing it.**

## Overview
One of the most helpful ways I have learned programming concepts is through
seeing someone else's attempt at exactly the same problem. Where this can
be a problem, (especially as a beginner) is that you seldom actually know the
person on the other side of the code, and their relative merits as a programmer.
They may say their version of the code is "Best Practices," but if they just
started learning programming 6 weeks ago, how am I to distinguish that? By making
this a game amongst coworkers, that problem _should be_ mitigated. ;)

## Organization
Each week, a new challenge will be posted in this repo. It will contain a README
file with the description of the challenge, and a seed file which will contain the
required base code (so we all have the same starting point) and some tests (so we all
work toward the same goal). Initially, each week will either be a Python challenge
or a Javascript challenge, though we can certainly start branching into other languages
as interest arises (I'm looking at you C#). For now, I will be doing all the challenge
organization, but I would love to start cycling who creates the weekly challenges (maybe
cycle by sprint?). 

## Participation
To participate, rename the `base.py` file for that week as `your_name.py` and move it to
the submissions directory inside that week, then make a PR. Please try and refrain from 
looking into other people's submissions until you have actually completed it yourself. 
No cheating ;)

At the end of the week, I will concatenate all of the submissions into
a single file and post it in slack so that we can all look at each other's 
work side-by-side.

#### Note:
I got this idea from a [codewars.com](www.codewars.com). If one challenge a week
isn't enough for you, give this website a look. If you sign up and start participating
here, let me know so we can find each other and become allies!
